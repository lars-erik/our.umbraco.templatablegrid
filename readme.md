# Our Umbraco Templatable Grid

## Warning

**If you change an existing datatype from "Grid" to "Templatable Grid, you'll lose your configuration.**  
**Make sure you note down your layouts and rows before you change.**

## Overview

The templatable grid editor allows you to create pre-populated grids for new documents.
For each data type, you can configure a default layout, a set of rows and cells, including content. 
The default layout will be applied to all new documents using the configured data type.

## Usage

In addition to the built-in prevalues for layout and RTE configuration,
there is an additional prevalue for the default layout.
When changing the layout configuration,
you may have to use the "Reset layout" button to be able to create a new layout.
